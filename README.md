# Unit 4 - Sprint 13 - Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Assignment 2 - Vector Representations

In this project, we will be working with job listings from indeed.com that have the title "Data Scientist". We will remove HTML tags from the job descriptions and process the text using Spacy tokenizer. Next, we will build our own tokenizer and use sklearn CountVectorizer to get word counts for each listing. We will create a document-term matrix and a tf-idf feature matrix and convert each document into a vector. Finally, we will use this work to build a search engine that can query the job listings and find documents that are similar to the job listings that we desire.
